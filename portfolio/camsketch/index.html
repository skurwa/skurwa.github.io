      <br>The objective of this project was to engage motor-impaired elementary school art students with a 1 degree-of-freedom accessible sketching mechanism.
      As shown in the function model, our plan was to use accelerometer input (motion from the students) as the control signal to run a motor.

      Our initial concept was to use two cams to translate X and Y position data independently. This made the  primary challenge
      to generate cam profiles from a desired image. I worked on this problem using MATLAB and wrote a program that would trace an image input (left) and generate
      the required X and Y cam profiles (center). With this profile data and a few steps to translate the data to a Solidworks sketch, these cams were lasercut (right).

      After verifying that the cams did work, our attention turned to the mechanical development. There were a lot of tricky challenges here to ensure that the position displacement of the cam was fully transferred to the end effector.
      To do so, we ensured our joints were prismatic, corners were gussetted, and the transmission material was rigid (stainless steel). To get to that point, we went through a round of prototyping to identify areas that needed the most improvement.
