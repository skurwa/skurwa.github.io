I've struggled to find the time and motivation to actually build a website. Today, however, I decided I could do better than <a href="https://www.tinyurl.com/SiddharthKurwaPortfolio" target="_blank">a PDF on Google Drive</a> to showcase myself on the internet. I used <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" target="_blank">Jonathan McGlone's tutorial</a> to get started. His template and start-up guide made it extremely easy to dive in quickly. Looking forward to where this goes!
