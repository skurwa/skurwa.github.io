      <title>Jain Mentorship Program</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As 3rd year undergraduate students in 2017, my friend, Mishi, and I reflected on how we&amp;rsquo;d evolved from the people we were in high school. Our high school selves were naive, and we were fortunate to have received the necessary guidance to reach our present situations. At that moment, we felt a call to action to pass the torch forward by offering mentorship to high schoolers. We were part of a local Jain youth community - a perfect place to begin testing the waters for a high school mentorship program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed a program to pair high school juniors and seniors who are in the thick of college preparation and admissions with college mentors. These mentors were tasked to challenge them to consider important steps and nudge them forward through monthly check-ins. Mishi and I prepared relevant and varying content for mentors to use in their discussions with mentees. Content themes included college research, selecting majors, resume editing, scholarship apps, and essay writing. Mishi and I also developed webinars, social events, and workshops to provide a broader variety of programming to meet needs of mentees. Many of the new features we began implementing in the program were conceived through feedback forms. From the program initiation, we emphasized constant mentee and mentor feedback. This feedback has enabled the program to meet user needs and desires that Mishi and I had not initially identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, we&amp;rsquo;ve connected over 30 high schoolers with college mentors and received overwhelming appreciation from mentees and mentors for developing this platform. With the 3rd year officically under way in 2019, the Jain Mentorship Program has a team of 4 coordinators and a handful of advisors to plan workshops, webinars, social events, monthly mentorship programming, and the future growth and sustenance of the program on a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pitching Machine</title>
      <link>/project/pitchingmachine/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/pitchingmachine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an intern at M3 Design, I helped develop a pitching machine for a client. We began with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.athlonic.com/products/wheelerdealer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;off-the-shelf product&lt;/a&gt; as the foundation and added or modified features until we developed all the functionality required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my co-worker designed and fabricated a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanism to enable a controllable pitching window, I focused on developing pitching control. For this, I started by characterizing the existing pitching machine which used a linear solenoid (a device that creates a magnetic field to exert a linear force on a plunger) to pitch the ball.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;linearSolenoid.gif&#34; &gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Linear Solenoid&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Charcterization involved using an oscilloscope to determining transient operating voltage, peak current, output current decay as battery life wore down, and pulse-width-modulation (PWM) for variable force setting. Upon characterizing, I learned a bit about our electrical/control design - first, the peak amperage draw of the solenoid exceeded 100 amps (albeit for a very short time) and second, it became clear that the SLA battery power supply would be an issue. With continued use, power output from the SLA batteries decayed substantially and deteriorated the pitching window&amp;rsquo;s consistency. Therefore, I decided to try using a battery charging circuit to continually &amp;lsquo;top off&amp;rsquo; the batteries with charge when not in use. However, this was harder than I anticipated. Lead acid batteries (as used in the device), follow a particular charging cycle shown on the below plot.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;SLACharging.jpg&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To maximize battery life, we could only perform Stage 2 or Stage 3 charge cycles. However, these stages did not provide sufficient current in the allotted charge time to replenish the charge consumed during discharge time (firing the solenoid). Further, lead-acid batteries do not have long charge/discharge life cylces and begin to degrade within 200-300 discharge cycles according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/archive/can_the_lead_acid_battery_compete_in_modern_times&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Battery University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I went back to the drawing board and considered an alternative - capacitors. Capacitors, by nature, are designed to handle repeated charge/discharge cycles with minimal wear and are capable of handling more current being pumped in during the charge state than chemical batteries. Due to their charge/discharge robustness], we began exploring using capacitors to provide the instantaneous peak current draw above 100A and sustain the lifespan of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sizing, ordering, and integrating the capacitors that we&amp;rsquo;d need, it certainly looked ridiculous&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;capBank.jpg&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;but it worked! Using MOSFETs to switch on/off capacitor charging and discharging (and frying some in the process) and an Arduino to provide the control signal, we were able to sustain a consistent pitching window and install a successful product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final prototype installed and featured in local news:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automated Medical Handpiece Cleaner</title>
      <link>/project/handpiececleaner/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/handpiececleaner/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While an intern at M3 Design, I had the unique opportunity of owning the full development of a prototype medical device&amp;rsquo;s control system. The product is intended to clean and lubricate the internals of a client&amp;rsquo;s medical handpieces, improving tool life and sustained quality.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;handpiece.png&#34; &gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Medical Handpieces&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To begin, I started by laying out the state machine architecture with a simple breadboarded mock-up using LEDs, switches, pushbuttons, and a display.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;mockUp.png&#34; &gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Initial Mock-Up&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the basic states laid out and control developed, I began integrating physical components - motors, pumps, and sensors. With these physical components, processes within each state could be defined, forming a hierarchical state machine and functional physical form.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;functional.png&#34; &gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Functional Prototype&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Physical components also added another layer of complexity with debounce, power supply, overload, and motor control issues. Troubleshooting each one-by-one took time to get right, but it was an excellent way to understand the challenges in transitioning a theoretical idea or mock-up into a physical, useful device. With the physical system, we also worked on tuning the mechanical function of the device. With the mechanical design engineer, I worked to ensure that the pumps were providing the desired fluid pressure head, flowrate, and cycle duration and iteratively tuned the open-loop saturation and gain with sense resistors on the motor driver and control parameters (PWM settings).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;openLoopControl.png&#34; &gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Open-Loop Control&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the mechanical and control functions solved, user interface and experience took center-stage. Working with the team&amp;rsquo;s industrial designer, we determined workflows the user might follow, edge cases, and information to communicate to the user at each stage (alarm notifications and status/state indicators).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;userWorkflow.png&#34; &gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Sample UI Test Case&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With all the pieces (controls, mechanical, UI) figured out, we finally pieced the prototype together for delivery to the client. This particular project was a great experience in negotiating needs/requirements across a cross-functional team (industrial design, mechanical engineering, and controls engineering). The final prototype was a beautiful &lt;i&gt;and functional&lt;/i&gt; testament to everyone&amp;rsquo;s hard work and collaboration!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SpaceX Crew Dragon Ocean Recovery</title>
      <link>/project/crewdragonoceanrecovery/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/crewdragonoceanrecovery/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While an intern at SpaceX in Fall 2017, I had the opportunity to design and develop parts to support Crew Dragon Ocean Recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my internship, if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t designing parts in Siemens NX or analyzing them with ANSYS FEA at headquarters, I was working from the docks in San Pedro, CA with the ocean recovery vessels. I had the opportunity design, analyze, draft, and procure the parts that I designed - and actually see them get used! This experience was truly rewarding as it gave me a cradle-to-grave perspective on how parts develop from concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary contribution at SpaceX was developing the &amp;ldquo;horse collar.&amp;rdquo; As seen in the above picture, the horse collar is the strap that sits around the capsule to minimize swinging of the vessel during hoist. As the capsule is being designed to carry people to space, astronaut safety during ocean recovery is critical to mission success. Excessive swinging during hoist and capsule placement can seriously injure astronauts, damage the capsule, or damage the ocean vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several competing requirements to design around - maximize astronaut safety, minimize capsule damage, maximize equipment reusability, maximize ease of operational use, and minimize cost to name a few. Compromises and trade-offs were made to handle the competing requirements and arrive at the solution for which I participated in 3 operational offshore tests to gather insights, opportunities, and validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the conclusion of my internship, I presented a preliminary design review to the team, prepared a critical design review, identified a vendor to fabricate the horse collar, and worked with the supplier&amp;rsquo;s project engineer to develop the part to our required specifications. Prior to the internship, I was fairly unexposed to slings and rigging equipment, but I was able to quickly learn and drive design decisions by the end of the internship to push this project forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, the ocean recovery operation had its first real mission - SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-1. On reviewing the footage, I was excited to see the horse collar on the capsule was nearly identical to the one I developed in my internship! See ocean recovery footage below:&lt;/p&gt;
