Our high school selves were naive, and we were fortunate to have received guidance to achieve what we\u0026rsquo;d achieved. At that realization, we felt a call to action to pass the torch forward by offering mentorship to high school students. We were part of a local Jain youth community - a perfect place to begin testing the waters for a high school mentorship program.\nThrough hours of brainstorming and planning, we crafted a program to pair high school juniors and seniors in the thick of college preparation and admissions with college mentors. These mentors were tasked to challenge and nudge them along college applications through monthly check-ins. Mishi and I prepared relevant and varying content for mentors to use in their discussions with mentees. Content themes included college research, selecting majors, resume editing, scholarship apps, and essay writing. Mishi and I also developed webinars, social events, and workshops to provide a broader variety of programming to meet needs of mentees. Below is a sample presentation that we developed and encouraged mentors to present.\n Many of the new features we began implementing in the program were conceived through feedback forms. From the program initiation, we constantly sought out mentee and mentor feedback. This feedback loop has enabled the program to swiftly adapt to best satisfy user desires that Mishi and I had not initially identified.\nOver the past two years, we\u0026rsquo;ve connected over 30 high schoolers with college mentors and received overwhelmingly positive appreciation from mentees and mentors for building this platform. With the 3rd year officically under way in 2019, the Jain Mentorship Program has grown to a team of 4 coordinators and a handful of advisors to plan new workshops, webinars, events, content, and the future growth and sustenance of the program on a national level.\n","date":1562914800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562914800,"objectID":"7f24afd45345b216b3f08b3d958c8a54","permalink":"/project/jainmentorshipprogram/","publishdate":"2019-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/jainmentorshipprogram/","section":"project","summary":"Community mentorship program to support high school students through college admissions.","tags":["service"],"title":"Jain Mentorship Program","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page is still in development - please see my portfolio in the meantime.

To start, I prepared and submitted a proposal to the Department of Mechanical Engineering that identified a project advisor - Dr. Carolyn Seepersad, outlined the project scope, and estimated the necessary budget and timeline.\nWith Dr. Seepersad\u0026rsquo;s support after reviewing the proposal, I began pursuing the project to design and prototype a shopping cart that could navigate a grocery store. The stretch goal was for the cart to follow a user around the store, but the minimum technical requirements I imposed on myself for the semester was to design the cart to carry a 25 lbf payload, implement motor control, and develop an obstacle avoidance strategy.\nMajor tasks involved mechanical design, electrical design, and controls development.\nI initially started with the mechanical prototype by analyzing a viable drive system to carry the 25 lbf payload, designing the system using SolidWorks, and prototyping the design. The final design after iterating through SolidWorks is shown below.\n\rMechanical Design\r\r\rFor electrical design, I decided to use a distributed computing network over the I2C communication protocol. By using a network, I could dedicate individual Arduinos to collecting encoder clicks with interrupts and minimize the risk of missing interrupts as the motor\u0026rsquo;s encoders could click at 3500 Hz at walking speed. Further, the ultrasonic proximity sensors I selected for the obstacle avoidance task required using a delay between the trigger and the echo. This delay would slow down the loop rate of the Arduino (in an undistributed architecture) substantially, causing missed encoder signals and inaccurate wheel velocity measurements for speed control. The distributed network allowed tasks to be managed at asynchronous loop rates and requested on-demand. The planned communication architecture is shown below.\n\rCommunications Architecture\r\r\rThe other major task was to develop the control strategy for motor control and obstacle avoidance. I had chosen to use ultrasonic sensors, encoders, and a compass as my sensor inputs. Input from these sensors could be used to manage the decision-making of the system. First, I laid out the architecture in a function block diagram.\n\rControl Strategy\r\r\rWith the PIDs from the block diagram implemented in the Arduino, the next step was to give the controller a way to determine heading and speed setpoints based on environmental factors (obstacle avoidance). To do this, I first simplified the task by assuming that the cart should go forward by default unless an obstacle is detected in its path. Once an obstacle is detected, a decision must be made to pass the obstacle. This strategy is depicted in the following graphic.\n\rObstacle Avoidance\r\r\rAt the conclusion of the semester, this project has given me comprehensive exposure and confidence in independently taking a smart product concept from ideation to prototype - a true testament to my four-year engineering education at the University of Texas at Austin! In particular, this project has inspired me to wopursue a career with early-stage prototyping of smart products and pursue graduate school to enhance my core skills and theoretical knowledge of human-machine interaction.\n","date":1543737600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543737600,"objectID":"743def0698c69ebe651b346613169660","permalink":"/project/smartcart/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/smartcart/","section":"project","summary":"Independent research project to prototype a motorized, obstacle avoiding, Arduino-controlled shopping cart.","tags":["academic","arduino","mechatronics","mech-design","control-systems"],"title":"Smart Cart","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"For my senior design project, I led a team of 4 students in developing a device to fabricate low-cost menstrual pads in Syrian refugee crisis regions for the Red Cross.

We began with an off-the-shelf product as the foundation and added or modified features until we developed all the functionality required.\nWhile my co-worker designed and fabricated a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanism to enable a controllable pitching window, I focused on developing pitching control. For this, I started by characterizing the existing pitching machine which used a linear solenoid (a device that creates a magnetic field to exert a linear force on a plunger) to pitch the ball.\n\rLinear Solenoid\r\r\rCharcterization involved using an oscilloscope to determining transient operating voltage, peak current, output current decay as battery life wore down, and pulse-width-modulation (PWM) for variable force setting. Upon characterizing, I learned a bit about our electrical/control design - first, the peak amperage draw of the solenoid exceeded 100 amps (albeit for a very short time) and second, it became clear that the SLA battery power supply would be an issue. With continued use, power output from the SLA batteries decayed substantially and deteriorated the pitching window\u0026rsquo;s consistency. Therefore, I decided to try using a battery charging circuit to continually \u0026lsquo;top off\u0026rsquo; the batteries with charge when not in use. However, this was harder than I anticipated. Lead acid batteries (as used in the device), follow a particular charging cycle shown on the below plot.\n\r\rTo maximize battery life, we could only perform Stage 2 or Stage 3 charge cycles. However, these stages did not provide sufficient current in the allotted charge time to replenish the charge consumed during discharge time (firing the solenoid). Further, lead-acid batteries do not have long charge/discharge life cylces and begin to degrade within 200-300 discharge cycles according to Battery University.\nTherefore, I went back to the drawing board and considered an alternative - capacitors. Capacitors, by nature, are designed to handle repeated charge/discharge cycles with minimal wear and are capable of handling more current being pumped in during the charge state than chemical batteries. Due to their charge/discharge robustness], we began exploring using capacitors to provide the instantaneous peak current draw above 100A and sustain the lifespan of the device.\nAfter sizing, ordering, and integrating the capacitors that we\u0026rsquo;d need, it certainly looked ridiculous\u0026hellip;\n\r\r\u0026hellip;but it worked! Using MOSFETs to switch on/off capacitor charging and discharging (and frying some in the process) and an Arduino to provide the control signal, we were able to sustain a consistent pitching window and install a successful product.\nFinal prototype installed and featured in local news:\n  ","date":1539586800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539586800,"objectID":"ec887470dc02a24261dbdbbfbc4fabee","permalink":"/project/pitchingmachine/","publishdate":"2018-10-15T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/pitchingmachine/","section":"project","summary":"Patent-pending actuated and controllable pitching machine.","tags":["prof","arduino","mechatronics","mech-design"],"title":"Pitching Machine","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"While an intern at M3 Design, I had the unique opportunity of owning the full development of a prototype medical device\u0026rsquo;s control system. The product is intended to clean and lubricate the internals of a client\u0026rsquo;s medical handpieces, improving tool life and sustained quality.\n\rMedical Handpieces\r\r\rTo begin, I started by laying out the state machine architecture with a simple breadboarded mock-up using LEDs, switches, pushbuttons, and a display.\n\rInitial Mock-Up\r\r\rWith the basic states laid out and control developed, I began integrating physical components - motors, pumps, and sensors. With these physical components, processes within each state could be defined, forming a hierarchical state machine and functional physical form.\n\rFunctional Prototype\r\r\rPhysical components also added another layer of complexity with debounce, power supply, overload, and motor control issues. Troubleshooting each one-by-one took time to get right, but it was an excellent way to understand the challenges in transitioning a theoretical idea or mock-up into a physical, useful device. With the physical system, we also worked on tuning the mechanical function of the device. With the mechanical design engineer, I worked to ensure that the pumps were providing the desired fluid pressure head, flowrate, and cycle duration and iteratively tuned the open-loop saturation and gain with sense resistors on the motor driver and control parameters (PWM settings).\n\rOpen-Loop Control\r\r\rWith the mechanical and control functions solved, user interface and experience took center-stage. Working with the team\u0026rsquo;s industrial designer, we determined workflows the user might follow, edge cases, and information to communicate to the user at each stage (alarm notifications and status/state indicators).\n\rSample UI Test Case\r\r\rWith all the pieces (controls, mechanical, UI) figured out, we finally pieced the prototype together for delivery to the client.

I had the opportunity design, analyze, draft, and procure the parts that I designed - and actually see them get used! This experience was truly rewarding as it gave me a cradle-to-grave perspective on how parts develop from concepts.\nMy primary contribution at SpaceX was developing the \u0026ldquo;horse collar.\u0026rdquo; As seen in the above picture, the horse collar is the strap that sits around the capsule to minimize swinging of the vessel during hoist. As the capsule is being designed to carry people to space, astronaut safety during ocean recovery is critical to mission success. Excessive swinging during hoist and capsule placement can seriously injure astronauts, damage the capsule, or damage the ocean vessel.\nThere were several competing requirements to design around - maximize astronaut safety, minimize capsule damage, maximize equipment reusability, maximize ease of operational use, and minimize cost to name a few. Compromises and trade-offs were made to handle the competing requirements and arrive at the solution for which I participated in 3 operational offshore tests to gather insights, opportunities, and validation.\nBy the conclusion of my internship, I presented a preliminary design review to the team, prepared a critical design review, identified a vendor to fabricate the horse collar, and worked with the supplier\u0026rsquo;s project engineer to develop the part to our required specifications. Prior to the internship, I was fairly unexposed to slings and rigging equipment, but I was able to quickly learn and drive design decisions by the end of the internship to push this project forward.\nIn March 2019, the ocean recovery operation had its first real mission - SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-1. On reviewing the footage, I was excited to see the horse collar on the capsule was nearly identical to the one I developed in my internship!
